Experiment 6 - Obstacle Detector And Distance Measuring Device
In this experiment we designed an Obstacle Detector And Distance Measuring Device with the help of an Arduino UNO.
Aim:
To design a Obstacle Detector And Distance Measuring Device.

Apparatus:
Arduino Board, LED, Resistance - 220ohm, Breadboard, Wires, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.
Arduino Code:
//Obstacle Detector And Distance Measuring Device
const int trig = 10;
const int echo = 9;
long duration;
int distance;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(trig, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echo, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  
  digitalWrite(trig, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
    
  duration= pulseIn(echo, HIGH);
  distance= duration*0.034/2;
  
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.println(distance);
}

## Result:
The obstacle and its distance was verified after uploading the program.
